# Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms are sometimes the best solution for NP-complete problems. Greedy algorithms work by selecting the best local choice at each step of the problem, but not necessarily the best choice possible. This often makes them simple and fast and they often do well enough to make them viable options when the alternative is an algorithm that could take years to run for even a small dataset.
