# Linked List

Linked lists are a data structure for holding an ordered collection of items. Linked lists consist of nodes that point to other nodes, creating a chain of links.

Relative to arrays, linked lists are better quick insertion and removal at any location (if given the node where the action will take place), and worse at reads of a specified location.

* find/read: O(n)
* insert: O(1)
* delete: O(1)
