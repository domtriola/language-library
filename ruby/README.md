# Ruby

## Getting Started

[Official Site](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

* [Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
* Execute a ruby file: `ruby code.rb`
* Run ruby in an interpreter: `irb` (or `pry` for a better experience)
* Use gems to enhance projects: `gem install GEMNAME`
* Use [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) to manage your gems

## Key Features

* **Programming Paradigm**: Object-oriented - Reflective
* **Typing Discipline**: Dynamic - Strong - Duck

Everything is an object (well almost everything -- blocks aren't and neither are general language constructs like 'if').
