## Overview

Python is an object-oriented language that emphasizes readability, simplicity, and explicitness. For more elaboration of the "Pythonic" way, type `import this` into a python interpreter.

Python is often compared to Ruby, because they are human readable, high level, object-oriented languages with a similar syntactical feel. One of the main differences I have noticed in the philosophy behind both languages is that Ruby offers many "right" ways to do something, where Python suggests that there should only be one obvious way to do something.

## Getting Started

[Official Site](https://www.python.org/)

* [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Execute a python file: `python code.py`
* Run python in an interpreter: `python`
* Import modules and packages in projects: `import MODULE from PACKAGE`
* Use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to manage your dependencies
* Use `pyenv` and `pyenv-virtualenv` to manage python versions and environments
  * Tip: `pyenv global system && cd ~/ && pyenv local <desired_version>` to use pyenv versions everywhere

## Key Features

* **Programming Paradigm**: Object-oriented - Functional - Reflective
* **Typing Discipline**: Dynamic - Strong - Duck
