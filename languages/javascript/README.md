## Overview

[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is an implementation of the [ECMAScript](http://www.ecma-international.org/) specification standard. It is a multi-paradigm language that was originally created for client-side web-based programming. It is now commonly used as a server language as well (as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)). JavaScript has countless libraries and frameworks available to develop with, which can make it a daunting ecosystem to navigate. The ecosystem has also been know to change rapidly. The vast majority of websites used to use vanilla JavaScript and/or [jQuery](https://jquery.com/). Now other frameworks/libraries like [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) have become increasingly popular.

## Getting Started

[Official Site](https://www.ecma-international.org/)

* [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Execute a file with Node: `node code.js`
* Open the Node interpreter: `node`

## Key Features

* **Programming Paradigm**: Prototypal - Object-oriented - Functional - Event-driven
* **Typing Discipline**: Dynamic - Weak - Duck

### The Language of the Browser

JavaScript is the language that browsers run. Pretty much any client-side functionality will either be written in JavaScript, some flavor of JavaScript, or a language that compiles to JavaScript. There are some exceptions, like animations done with [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) or [Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash), but JavaScript will be a core part of pretty much any non-trivial web application.

### Prototypal Inheritance

### Event-driven

### Concurrency

### Libraries

From interface libraries, to server libraries, to audio, video, and graphical animation libraries, JavaScript has a plethora of libraries to help tackle specific tasks.
